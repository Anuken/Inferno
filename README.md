# [Inferno](https://anuken.github.io/inferno)

Unfinished bullet hell boss battle, as a collab between:
- me (*programming, animations, effects, map, design, etc*), and 
- Hai Yo (*concepts, character art, [cover art](cover.png), design, dialogue, etc*).

### How many phases are there?

Four. Nothing happens after that.

### Will this ever be finished?

Not in Java. The code here is terrible.

### I'm having issues compiling this!

Make sure you have a copy of the latest [Arc](https://github.com/Anuken/Arc) repo **next** to the Inferno project folder. 

I provide no support for issues with compilation; this project is not being worked on.
